            <div className="about-content">Hello, I am Karahan GÃ¼ner and I created Challenger Builds as a passion project in February of 2021. I wanted to create a website where players could get the best builds from challenger players. I automated a system that gets the challenger players across servers, their match history and their match data. This automated process happens once a day and keeps the data on this website always up to date. Only last 50 matches of players are fetched, making it impossible to serve outdated match data.</div>
